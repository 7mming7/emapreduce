# Access links and ports {#concept_vyw_f24_y2b .concept}

This section serves as a quick portal for components.

When a cluster is created, several domain names are bound to it by default so that you can access the following open source components:

-   HDFS
-   YARN
-   Spark
-   Hue
-   Ganglia

In the **Cluster Management** page, click **Manage** or **View Details**, and find the **Access Links and Ports** tab where you can see links for these components.

By default, there is no user name or password required for access, which means that the access request cannot pass the HTTP authentication. Click **Set User Name and Password** to set a user name and password to access your component interface.

Only one user name and one password can be used. A new user name and password will always replace previous ones.

**Note:** Currently, this function is only supported by version 2.3 and later.
