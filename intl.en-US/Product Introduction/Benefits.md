# Benefits {#concept_j4w_dky_w2b .concept}

E-MapReduce has some practical strength over self-built clusters. For example, it provides some convenient and controllable means to manage its clusters. In addition, it also has the following strengths:

-   Usability

    User can select the required ECS types and disks and select the required software for automatic deployment.

    Users can apply for cluster resources at the corresponding position according to the geographical location where users or the data source are located. Now, Alibaba Cloud ECS supports regions, including China East 1, China East 2, China North 1, China North 2, China South 1, Singapore, Hong Kong, US East 1 and US West 1. E-MapReduce supports regions including China North 2, China East 1, China East 2 and China South 1, and later it will extend to all the regions supported by Alibaba Cloud ECS.

-   Low price

    The user can create a cluster as needed, that is, it can release the cluster after an offline task running is completed and add a node dynamically when needed.

-   Deep integration

    E-MapReduce can be subject to deep integration with other Alibaba Cloud products, so that they can be used as the input source or output destination of Hadoop/Spark calculation engine in the E-MapReduce product.

-   Security

    E-MapReduce integrates Alibaba Cloud RAM resource permission management system, so that it can isolate the service permissions through the primary account or sub-accounts.
