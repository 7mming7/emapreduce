# Benefits {#concept_j4w_dky_w2b .concept}

E-MapReduce has some practical strength over the self-built clusters. For example, it provides some convenient and controllable means to manage its clusters.

In addition, it also has the following strengths:

-   Easy to use

    The user can select the required ECS types and disks and select the required software for automatic deployment.

-   Low price

    The user can create a cluster as needed, that is, it can release the cluster after an offline task running is completed and add a node dynamically when needed.

-   Deep integration

    E-MapReduce is deeply integrated with other Alibaba Cloud products \(such as OSS, MNS, RDS, and MaxCompute\) and can be used as the input source or output destination of the Hadoop/Spark computing engine.

-   SecurityÂ 

    E-MapReduce integrates Alibaba Cloud RAM resource permission management system, so that it can isolate the service permissions through the primary account or sub-accounts.
