As shown in the figure, an E-MapReduce cluster is built based on the Hadoop ecosystem. This allows data to be exchanged seamlessly with cloud services, such as Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\) and ApsaraDB \(RDS\), and enables you to share and transfer data between multiple systems. This meets the access needs of different types of businesses.
