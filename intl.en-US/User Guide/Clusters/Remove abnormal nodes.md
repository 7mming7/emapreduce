# Remove abnormal nodes {#concept_ekn_q4s_qfb .concept}

If an ECS node in an E-MapReduce cluster is abnormal, and if you do not need this node and want to remove it, you can do so.

To remove an abnormal node, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud E-MapReduce console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/emr).
2.  At the top of the page, click Cluster Management.
3.  Click the ID link of the cluster that includes the node that you want to remove.
4.  In the navigation pane on the left, click **Hosts**.
5.  Find the instance that you want to remove, and in the action column, click **Remove**. ECS instances can only be removed when they are in a stopped or released status.
6.  Click **OK** to remove the instance.
