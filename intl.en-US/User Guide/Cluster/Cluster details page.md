-   **Name**: The name of a cluster.
-   **ID**: The instance ID of a cluster.
-   **Region**: The region where a cluster is located.
-   **Start Time**: The creation time of a cluster.
-   **Software Configuration**: Software configurations.
-   **I/O Optimization**: Whether the I/O optimization setting is enabled.
-   **High Availability**: Whether high-availability clusters are enabled.
-   **Security Mode**: Software in clusters is started in Kerberos secure mode. For information about Kerberos, see [Introduction to Kerberos](intl.en-US/User Guide/Kerberos authentication/Introduction to Kerberos.md#).
-   **Billing Method**: Cluster payment typeã€‚
-   **Current Status**: See [Cluster status](../../../../intl.en-US/.md#).
-   **Runtime**: Clusters run time.
-   **Bootstrap**: The names, paths, and parameters of all configured bootstrap actions are listed here.
-   **ECS Role**: When your program runs on an EMRcompute node, you can access the related Alibaba Cloud services, such OSS, without an AccessKey. EMR automatically requests a temporary AccessKey to authorize this access. The permission control of this temporary AccessKey is controlled by this role.

-   **Cluster Type**: The selected cluster type.
-   **Software**: All application programs installed and their versions are listed here, such as HDFS2.7.2, Hive 2.3.3, and spark 2.3.1.
