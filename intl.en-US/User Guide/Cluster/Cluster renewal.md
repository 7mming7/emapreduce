## Pay for orders {#section_qvf_mxn_y2b .section}

**Note:** The fees are the sum of ECS renewal price and E-MapReduce service product price. If there are unpaid orders in the cluster list, you cannot expand or renew any clusters.

1.  Click **OK** to view the prompt box for successful order placement.
2.  Click **Go to the payment page**. The payment page displays the total amount and order details of E-MapReduce services ECS intances.
3.  Click **Confirm payment**.
4.  After you make the payment, click **Payment completed** to return to the cluster list page.

The expiration time of successfully renewed clusters displayed on the cluster list page is updated to the time after renewal. For the corresponding ECS instance, the expiration time after the renewal is usually updated after about three to five minutes.

If you confirm the renewal order, but donâ€™t pay for it, **Cancel order** and **Make the payment** are displayed on the right side of the cluster. Click **Make the payment**to complete the corresponding order payment , or click **Cancel** to cancel the renewal.
