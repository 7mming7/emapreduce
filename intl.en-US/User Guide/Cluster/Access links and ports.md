# Access links and ports {#concept_vyw_f24_y2b .concept}

Quick portal for components.

When a cluster is created, several domain names are bound to the cluster by default for you to access your open source components:

-   HDFS
-   YARN
-   Spark
-   Hue
-   Ganglia

In the **Cluster Management** page, click **Manage** or **View Details**, and find the **Access Links and Ports** tab where you can see links of the preceding components.

By default, there is no username and password for accessing. Therefore, the access request cannot pass the HTTP authentication. You need to click **Set Username and Password** to set a username and password to access your component interface.

Only one username and one password can be used. Therefore, the new username and password will always replace the previous ones.

**Note:** Currently, this function is only supported by version 2.3 and later.
