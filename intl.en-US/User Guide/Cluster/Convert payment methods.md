# Convert payment methods {#concept_of2_l1p_y2b .concept}

There are two payment methods for EMR: Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription. We usually try to use EMR in Pay-As-You-Go method with a small cost. Once you confirm to use EMR for a long time, you can convert to the Subscription payment method.

## Convert Pay-As-You-Go to Subscription {#section_t5p_m1p_y2b .section}

You can select the Pay-As-You-Go method at the beginning for EMR trial, and then at any time, in the **Cluster Overview** panel, click the **Switch to Subscription** button to switch the cluster payment method from Pay-As-You-Go to Subscription. The payment method of the entire cluster will be switched.

## Convert Subscription to Pay-As-You-Go {#section_u5p_m1p_y2b .section}

Currently, converting Subscription to Pay-As-You-Go is not supported.
