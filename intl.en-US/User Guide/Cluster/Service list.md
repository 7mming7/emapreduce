# Service list {#concept_w2h_5tn_y2b .concept}

The Service list page has been added to the tab list of the cluster information page to show the running status of HDFS, YARN, and other services.

The running status of services are only showed for clusters that are in Idle or Running status. When creating a cluster, if the service you click is unchecked \(such as Storm\), you are prompted that no record is found.

The list includes status and the intranet IP. The status is divided into Running and Idle. If the status of a service on some node is Idle, you can use the master node to jump to the corresponding node, and check the service process.
