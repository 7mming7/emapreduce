# Cross-cluster access to Kafka {#concept_zkm_mcx_y2b .concept}

An independent Kafka cluster is deployed to provide the Kafka service. Therefore, you may need to access this service across cluster.

## Cross-cluster access to Kafka {#section_qm5_zcx_y2b .section}

Cross-cluster access to Kafka consists of two common types:

-   Access E-MapReduce Kakfa cluster from Alibaba Cloud internal network.
-   Access E-MapReduce Kakfa cluster from the public network.

Different solutions are prepared for different E-MapReduce versions.

## EMR-3.11.x and Later Versions {#section_c4v_bdx_y2b .section}

-   **Access Kafka from the Alibaba Cloud internal network**

    You can access Kafka service directly by using the internal IP address of a Kakfa cluster node. Use port 9092 to access Kafka from the internal network.

    Make sure that the networks are accessible before you access Kafka service:

    -   For more information about how to access a VPC from a classic network, see [Access between classic network and VPC](intl.en-US/User Guide/Configure cluster/Access between classic network and VPC.md#) here.
    -   For more information about how to access a VPC from another VPC, see [here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/65073.html).
-   **Access Kafka in the public network**

    The Core node of the Kafka cluster is unable to access to the public network by default. To access the Kafka cluster in the public network, perform the following steps:

    1.  Interconnect Kafka clusters with the public network.
        -   If Kafka clusters are deployed in a VPC environment, there are two ways:
            -   Deploy Express Connect to interconnect the VPC with the public network. For details, see [Express Connect](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/44848.html) document.
            -   Bind EIPs to cluster Core nodes. Perform the following steps to bind the EIP to the ECS:
        -   If Kafka is deployed in a classic network, there are two ways:
            -   To create a Pay-As-You-Go cluster, use ECS APIs. For details, see [API document](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/25544.html).
            -   To create a cluster through the Subscription method, you can directly assign a public IP address to relevant host in the ECS console.
    2.  Create an EIP in the [ECS console](https://vpcnext.console.aliyun.com/eip), and purchase relevant EIPs based on the number of Core nodes in the Kafka cluster.
    3.  Configure security group rules for the Kafka cluster to control public network access to the IP addresses of the Kafka cluster. The objective is to improve the security of the Kafka cluster exposed in the public network. You can view the security group to which the cluster belongs in the EMR console, and configure security group rules based on security group IDs.

    4.  On the **Cluster List** page of E-MapReduce console, click **Manage** after the specified cluster, select **Cluster Overview** on the left side of the page, and then click the **Sync Cluster Host Info** button in the upper right corner.
    5.  Restart the cluster Kafka service.
    6.  Use the EIP of the Kafka cluster node to access Kafka service in the public network. Use port 9093 to access Kafka service from the public network.

## Versions earlier than EMR-3.11.x {#section_lnz_hdx_y2b .section}

-   **Access Kafka from the Alibaba Cloud internal network**

    In this case, you must configure the host information of the Kafka cluster node on the client host. **Long domain** of the Kafka cluster node must be configured. Example:

    ```
    Ôºèetc/hosts
    # kafka cluster
    10.0.1.23 emr-header-1.cluster-48742
    10.0.1.24 emr-worker-1.cluster-48742
    10.0.1.25 emr-worker-2.cluster-48742
    10.0.1.26 emr-worker-3.cluster-48742
    ```

    4.  Modify the software configuration of the Kafka cluster listeners.address.principal to HOST, and restart the Kafka cluster.
    5.  Configure the hosts file on the local client host in accordance with the preceding [cross-cluster access to Kafka](#).
